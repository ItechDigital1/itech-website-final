      <ul>
        <li>
          The traditional approach of police recruitment was a challenging tasks
          both candidates and police officials. Challenges included the number
          of candidates turning up each day, rescheduling of events leading
          candidates to participate even in the afternoon heat, manipulation of
          candidate results and improper way of selection and marking system.
        </li>
        <li>
          To overcome these challenges a robust technology driven system was
          essential. Based on the opportunity given by Mumbai Police ITECH took
          up this challenge and pioneered this technology driven police
          recruitment physical test and digitalised it completely.
        </li>
        <li>
          ITECH was successful in completing the entire project in 20 days and
          catered to 60000+ candidates i.e. 3000 &#8211; 3500 candidates a day
          running 1.6kms in groups of 20 back to back at two different locations
          and two shifts. ITECH developed not only the hardware solution from
          the timing system but also developed the software. The system was also
          developed to handle grievances from candidates on their timings which
          were promptly resolved by playing their end time videos in slow motion
          and also options for rewind or forward and verify based on timestamp
          which was created on each video frame. Results generation was also
          prompt, it used to hardly take 15 minutes post their run to receive
          their results. This saved a lot of time, efforts, manpower and finally
          costs thus enabling systematic recruitment without any issues.

          Implemented Mumbai Police Technology Cell IT Infrastructure &#8211;
          Server Room, MPLS networking across Mumbai, Data and Network Security.
          Initially the existing infrastructure i.e. servers, network devices,
          storage devices and data and network security devices weren&#39;t
          available or lacked compatibility and scalability. Secondly for
          digitalisation of entire process there was always an issue due to
          these technological gaps and challenges. There was no connectivity
          between head office to other police stations too everything was
          operational in silos.
        </li>
        <li>
          ITECH managed to connect the Head office to 150 locations i.e. police
          stations with a MPLS connectivity and also end to end security by
          installing network security devices on each of these locations. VPN
          was also implemented for those who didn&#39;t have access to MPLS
          connectivity. Efficient backup and redundancy was also implemented.
          This created a robust and scalable platform to cater to their
          requirement of implementation of Police Information Systems which had
          multiple modules within it.
        </li>
        <li>
          All this was implemented with data storage, infrastructure scalability
          and data and network security keeping in mind the sensitivity of
          Mumbai Police Data and protecting it from International Hackers.

          Manual Fingerprint imprints were initially taken and also verified.
          This included lot of paper work and loss of documents etc. Lot of
          manpower was involved for getting the imprints and then verifying it
          required specially trained fingerprint experts. Non availability of
          experts led to delay in cases. Also need for digitalisation was
          important in order to eliminate all these issues.

        <li>
          The Automated Biometric Identification System was Conceptualized,
          Designed, Manufactured, and Sourced, installed and implemented by
          I.TECH in all the 95 Police Stations in Mumbai within Six months for
          capturing and recording and updating Criminal Data with Fingerprint,
          Iris, Photo and Demographic Data, to be further used for Artificial
          Intelligence and Crime pattern. With the Data transferred and stored
          on Secure Servers in the Server Room. This project is currently taken

          Police Notice, Room Allotment, Internal Mailing System, Service &
          Rewards Info, Vehicle Fleet Management, VMS etc. Since junior police
          staff had no access to computers in order to utilise this technology
          there was a need to build an interactive kiosk.

          each and every Police man with a Login User ID and Password for
          immediate access to his personal data including Leave application,
          Housing availability, Pension and Police News and Instructions. This
