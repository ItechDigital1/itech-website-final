            Despite the Stature of the Government Consultants there is still a

            <br />
            Irrespective of its kind, I.TECH over the last 3 Years as part of
            our “Give Back to the Community” perspective has rendered its
            services via its Innovation and Design outfit to assist the
            Modernization of Mumbai Police in Several Projects, from
            Conceptualization, Design, Manufacture, Installation,
            Implementation, Training and Maintenance to various areas that
            required attention. Several Projects were executed speedily in a
            matter of months as I.TECH was the one stop shop for all solutions.
            <br />
            I.TECH is always open to assist any Government Organization to
            Modernise their existing facilities no matter how challenging and

              Concept - Modernization of Mumbai Police Recruitment(Bharti) -
              Year 2016
            </header>
            <h6>Challange - </h6>
            <p className="font-italic">
              The traditional approach of police recruitment was a challenging
              tasks both candidates and police officials. Challenges included
              the number of candidates turning up each day, rescheduling of
              events leading candidates to participate even in the afternoon
              heat, manipulation of candidate results and improper way of
              selection and marking system.
            </p>
            <p className="font-italic">
              To overcome these challenges a robust technology driven system was
              essential. Based on the opportunity given by Mumbai Police ITECH
              took up this challenge and pioneered this technology driven police
              recruitment physical test and digitalised it completely.
            </p>
            <p className="font-italic">
              ITECH was successful in completing the entire project in 20 days
              and catered to 60000+ candidates i.e. 3000 &#8211; 3500 candidates
              a day running 1.6kms in groups of 20 back to back at two different
              locations and two shifts. ITECH developed not only the hardware
              solution from the timing system but also developed the software.
              The system was also developed to handle grievances from candidates
              on their timings which were promptly resolved by playing their end
              time videos in slow motion and also options for rewind or forward
              and verify based on timestamp which was created on each video
              frame. Results generation was also prompt, it used to hardly take
              15 minutes post their run to receive their results. This saved a
              lot of time, efforts, manpower and finally costs thus enabling
              systematic recruitment without any issues.

              Implemented Mumbai Police Technology Cell IT Infrastructure
              &#8211; Server Room, MPLS networking across Mumbai, Data and
              Network Security. Initially the existing infrastructure i.e.
              servers, network devices, storage devices and data and network
              security devices weren&#39;t available or lacked compatibility and
              scalability. Secondly for digitalisation of entire process there
              was always an issue due to these technological gaps and
              challenges. There was no connectivity between head office to other
              police stations too everything was operational in silos.
            </p>
            <p className="font-italic">
              ITECH managed to connect the Head office to 150 locations i.e.
              police stations with a MPLS connectivity and also end to end
              security by installing network security devices on each of these
              locations. VPN was also implemented for those who didn&#39;t have
              access to MPLS connectivity. Efficient backup and redundancy was
              also implemented. This created a robust and scalable platform to
              cater to their requirement of implementation of Police Information
              Systems which had multiple modules within it.

              All this was implemented with data storage, infrastructure
              scalability and data and network security keeping in mind the
              sensitivity of Mumbai Police Data and protecting it from
              International Hackers.

              Manual Fingerprint imprints were initially taken and also
              verified. This included lot of paper work and loss of documents
              etc. Lot of manpower was involved for getting the imprints and
              then verifying it required specially trained fingerprint experts.
              Non availability of experts led to delay in cases. Also need for
              digitalisation was important in order to eliminate all these
              issues.

              The implementation of MPIS only wasn&#39;t enough to cater to its
              objective. Even though MPIS had digitalised everything which
              included Police Notice, Room Allotment, Internal Mailing System,
              Service & Rewards Info, Vehicle Fleet Management, VMS etc. Since
              junior police staff had no access to computers in order to utilise

            I.TECH was instrumental in the Design and prototyping of the new
            base ball type P caps in the Mumbai Police which was changed for the
            first time after 100 years. It was a proud moment to be involved in
            the change of history in the Mumbai Police diaries. I.TECH sourced
            the supplier and is now delivering them to the staff at a reasonable
            price of Rs 65 per cap. This has now been copied all over
            Maharashtra and many parts of India as well.

          <p className="font-italic">
            The Mumbai Police Passport Branch had a challenge to implement,
            network, servers and storage solutions along with ruggedisation of
            fragile tablets.

          <p className="font-italic">
            The entire infrastructure was conventionalized depending on the
            software requirement from the government. They were then sourced and
            installed and are currently under 3 year&#39;s maintenance. Data and
            Network Security is upmost and these separate Servers are protected
            by advanced firewalls. Document scanners installed and maintained at
            all locations to ensure smooth online operations to the branch.

          <p className="font-italic">
            I.TECH has also Conceptualized, Designed, Manufactured, Sourced,
            Ruggedized and Supplied 300 Samsung tabs with Carry cases for the
            Passport verification process of the Mumbai Police Passport Branch
            (SBII) these are all weather used successfully and have a very low
            failure rate as the quality of Ruggedization was priority to ensure
            project success. The project is currently under 3 year&#39;s
            maintenance.
