        <li>
          ITech Digital Forensics developed a product called Chargester that has
          a charging mechanism that makes sure gadgets stay powered during the
          waiting period.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          By maintaining the gadgets' organization, cooling, and charging while
          intensive processing takes place.
        </li>
        <li>
          With well-known tools like GrayKey, Cellebrite, Magnet, XRY, BlackBag,
          Oxygen, and more, the cabinet provides the ideal pre-analysis
          environment for passcode unlocking and data extraction.
        </li>
        <br />
        <b>FEATURES</b>
        <li>
          The user can plainly examine device screens and contents within the
          cabinet thanks to its sturdy frame and transparent acrylic shelves and
          walls.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          Chargesters come with fully functional chambers that hold all the
          components needed to charge up to 18 or 30 gadgets simultaneously.
        </li>
        <li>
          A number of devices as well as related documents and case files can
          fit inside the roomy compartments.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          To maximize organization and screen visibility, the accessory kit
          comes with seven Forensic Crystal-Clear Phone Organizers, each of
          which can hold up to five smartphones upright.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          The most important aspect of the cabinet is its state-of-the-art
          Noctua fan cooling system. This system uses a NA-FC1 controller in
          conjunction with eight NF-P12 redux 1700 PWM fans lining both side
          walls to balance airflow and device temperature.{" "}

        <li>ITech Digital Forensics created a product known as Lockster.</li>
        <li>
          The latest forensic techniques require cell phones and tablets to be
          turned on in order to successfully access and recover data.
        </li>
        <li>
          It can be difficult to keep gadgets free of RF waves, charged at all
          times, and securely locked.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Lockster achieves all of these goals in a single cabinet that is
          specifically constructed for shielding, charging, and locking.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          The machine contains seven fully loaded compartments equipped with
          Window Charge & Shield Faraday Bags for Phones, with extra Charge &
          Shield Faraday Bags available as needed or to expand capacity.

        <b>FEATURES</b>
        <li>
          Lockster has a safe cabinet with 8/4 locker compartments intended
          exclusively to keep gadgets separately locked, shielded, and charged
          during the storage procedure.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          The system guarantees that the device is properly inserted and stored
          so that the passcode unlocking and data extraction procedure can be
          conducted correctly and efficiently.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          Lockster cabinets have a power socket with two USB power connectors
          and a distinctive outside lock.

          key dropbox with two keys.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          During the charging process, a power indicator light appears on the
          main cabinet. When the unit loses power, the power failure detector
          sends an SMS and/or email.{" "}
