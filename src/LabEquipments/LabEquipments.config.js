          By maintaining the gadgets' organization, cooling, and charging while
          intensive processing takes place.
        </li>
        <li>
          With well-known tools like GrayKey, Cellebrite, Magnet, XRY, BlackBag,
          Oxygen, and more, the cabinet provides the ideal pre-analysis
          environment for passcode unlocking and data extraction.

        <br />
        <b>FEATURES</b>
        <li>
          The user can plainly examine device screens and contents within the
          cabinet thanks to its sturdy frame and transparent acrylic shelves and
          walls.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          Chargesters come with fully functional chambers that hold all the
          components needed to charge up to 18 or 30 gadgets simultaneously.
        </li>
        <li>
          A number of devices as well as related documents and case files can
          fit inside the roomy compartments.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          To maximize organization and screen visibility, the accessory kit
          comes with seven Forensic Crystal-Clear Phone Organizers, each of
          which can hold up to five smartphones upright.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          The most important aspect of the cabinet is its state-of-the-art
          Noctua fan cooling system. This system uses a NA-FC1 controller in
          conjunction with eight NF-P12 redux 1700 PWM fans lining both side
          walls to balance airflow and device temperature.{" "}
